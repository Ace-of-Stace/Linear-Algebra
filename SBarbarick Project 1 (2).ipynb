    "#### A chemical equation is an expression that represents the reactants (substances that are altered) and the products (new substances that are created) of a chemical reaction. The Law of the Conservation of Mass dictates that mass of reactants and products must be equal and therefore the number of atoms per element remain constant from one side of the equation to the other. To obtain this balanced chemical equation, whole number integers are calculated and applied to products and reactants, so these atom ratios equalize. Balancing chemical equations is a fundamental skill in any chemical laboratory application since correct ratios of reagents are necessary to obtain desired products. \n",
    "#### Unfortunately, the traditional “guess and check” or algebra-based system that many chemists employ to balance such equations can become incredible difficult and time consuming as chemical equations become more complex. Until the early 1980s, many chemistry educators felt that it was impossible to balance the equations for some reactions by inspection or, possibly, or the arithmetic of the standard methods was “beyond the capabilities of most students”. [1]  A different methodology for balancing these complex equations was proposed in 1978 by E.V. Krishnamurthy which, “consists in solving exactly for the rational (non-trivial) solutions of a system of linear, homogeneous algebraic equations whose coefficient matrix (called the reaction matrix) is singular, by using the concept of the generalized inverse of a matrix.” [2]  In fact, this matrix-based approach, when applied correctly, is capable of balancing chemical equations faster, and with more parameters than traditional methods. [3] Once a general program for the linear algebra is coded, anyone can simple input the elements of the chemical equation and quickly solve for the balancing coefficients.\n"

    "#### While the process of balancing chemical equations can be done by hand, there are far more productive, time-saving and free computing tools available.  The example equation used above seems simplistic, however, it demonstrates the advantage gained by using technology in this application. A variation of the functioning code could be applied to any chemical equation, regardless of complexity. The small time investment in the creation of the code will be made up in dividends when it can be used quickly and easily in a countless number of applications. According to G.R Blakely, “the proper place for chemical reasoning is before the equation balancing process and after it, not during it”. [3] With programs such as these in place, scientists will be able to spend more time engaged in such pursuits.\n",
